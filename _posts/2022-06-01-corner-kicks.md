# What is this note about and who is it for?
I briefly present the structure of a typical analyst report about an __opponent's attacking corner kicks in soccer__. Then, I walk through an example of this type of report, focusing on Spanish club [SD Eibar](https://www.sdeibar.com/).

This note will interest you if:
* You are new to soccer match analysis and curious about what a report on attacking corner kicks looks like.
* You are a match analyst and are interested in similar work.
* You like the beautiful game.

This note is an expanded version of an assignment I completed as part of [FC Barcelona's Innovation Hub](https://https://barcainnovationhub.com/) course on Set Piece Analysis, which is a requirement for their Certificate in Advanced Football Tactical Analysis. In the last section you will find additional information, including the orginal powerpoint presentation, supporting videos, and tools used.

# Content and Structure of a Corner Kick Analysis Report
In elite soccer, match analysts support the coaching staff with analyses of their own team and the opponents. One of their duties is to prepare reports focusing on the opponent's set pieces, of which corner kicks are one component. Corner kick analyses can be further divived in *defensive* (when the opponent is defending against a rival's corner kick) and *attacking* (when the opponent is taking the corner kick). The content and structure of these two views is similar, but here I focus only on the *attacking* corner kicks.

The content of the report will strongly depend on the specific interests of the coaching staff. The format and structure must also adapt to their needs: some coaches prefer a short video and verbal talking points; others prefer a PowerPoint presentation with embedded videos; some coaches are more quantitative than others, which affects the balance of numbers and images in the report. Finally, there should be absolute clarity on the timeline for delivering the reports to the coaching staff. It is the job of the analyst to align the content, format, and deadline of the report to the coaches' needs.

Notwithstanding the need to adapt the report to the coaches, there are recurring, fundamental aspects of attacking corner kicks that will be of interest to just about any coach in any club. Your report must identify how the particular opponent interprets these fundamentals.

## Main characteristics to observe in attacking corner kicks

* __Structure:__ How is the team organized just before the kick?
  - In parallel lines inside/outside the small area? In a "conga line" down the middle? Clustered at the near/far post?
  - How many players in the small area / penalty area?
  - How many at the top of the area / preventive coverage?
  - What are the player locations on short kicks? 
* __Movements:__ How, where, and when do the players move during the kick?
  - Movement before the kick? Or only immediately before?
  - Any blocks, decoy runs, attempts to drag defenders to create space? 
* __Trajectory:__ How is the ball kicked? 
  - Inswinging
  - Outswinging
  - Flat
  - Short/indirect
* __Delivery location:__ Where does the ball arrive on the pitch?
  - Near post
  - Far post
  - Middle of small area
  - Penalty kick spot
  - Are attempts direct or do they arise from second balls/indirect flicks?
* __Habitual kickers:__ Which players usually take corner kicks?
  - Are they right/left footed?
  - Consequences of right/left footedness and side of the corner kick on the inswinging/outswinging trajectory
* __Habitual receivers:__ Which players usually receive the ball and/or attempt a shot? 
  - What are their main characteristics?
  - Do defenders push up to attempt to score?
* __Performance:__ Summary counts and statistics on the team's success in creating chances and scoring goals from corner kicks.
* __Patterns and correlations:__ Point out any correlations between the above characteristics. Example: inswinging kicks from the right of the goal to the near post yield more shots on goal.

Finally, __keep it short!__ Coaches have limited time, and need to digest various reports - not just corner kicks - so focus on the main points and be brief.   



![](img/corner_kicks2.png)

__Trajectory:__  direct kicks\, short pass not used as much

__Shooters:__  only right\-footed; \#14 \-Orellana and \#21 Leon

__Structure:__  5 players in area; 6 for unfavorable score

__Clearing and defense:__  2\-3 players at top of area; 1\-2 defense

__PLAYS__

__Inswinging:__  ball to  __near post__  for direct attempt or touch to second player in small area\.  __Overloading near post__  to create attempt or create space for players in small area\.

__Outswinging:__  direct ball to far post/penalty zone\.  __Fake movement__  to near post to create space at far post\.

__In general:__  players align immediately outside the small area in the penalty zone and rush in for attempt or to drag opponents to create space\.

__PERFORMANCE__

__Inswinging/near post__  →  __more attempts and shots__

__Outswinging/far post__  → more frequent

# Performance

__MOST__  OF THE  __ATTEMPTS__  COME FROM  __NEAR POST OR PENALTY ZONE __ DELIVERY

__INSWINGING __ PRODUCES  __MORE ATTEMPTS __ THAN OUTSWINGING

![](img/corner_kicks16.png)

![](img/corner_kicks17.png)

__SUMMARY__

__Inswinging/near post/penalty zone__  →  __more attempts and goals \(more effective\)__

__Outswinging/far post__  → more frequent but fewer attempts \(less effective\)

![](img/corner_kicks18.png)

# Inswinging

Overload the near post to obtain an attempt or to attract the opponent and create space in the small area in front of the goal or far post\.

![](img/corner_kicks19.jpg)

![](img/corner_kicks20.png)

# Outswinging

Runs to the near and far posts to drag/attracts opponents and create space in the penalty zone for strikers to head the ball from that zone\.
