![Luca's photo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/luca_photo_face.jpg) I am a **scientist** and a **technologist** with a successful track record in both academic research and product commercialization. I come from a **statistical signal processing** and **data analysis** background, which I developed into **machine learning** and **data science** expertise and applied to diverse fields. I have worked in both large, structured organizations and small, fluid startups, including my own AI consulting and advising outfit. I lead technical teams and communicate with the business units and subject matter experts at the appropriate level of granularity. At the same time, I remain solidly technical and contribute product specifications, system designs, visualizations, exploratory data analyses, prototypes, insights. I most enjoy connecting concepts from machine learning, AI and tools from data science to the semantics, constraints, and requirements of specific problems to deliver solutions that are practical, impactful, and backed by best practices.
